			<h1>Experiment 1 - Vector Germs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>My inspiration for this experiment drew from pieces such as the following: <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/13450284-Creative-Coding-Tusi-Couple">Creative Coding ° Tusi Couple by dudenas</a> and <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_6_1_03">M_6_1_03 by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni with contributions by Joey Lee and Niels Poldervaart</a>.</p>
				<p>I liked the look of the tree-like structure in patterns like binary search trees or in nature itself, so I wanted to try to emulate these characteristics in my experiment. I chose to start with the artwork “M_6_1_03” to base my experiment on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>To get the “tree” structure that I was looking for, I disabled the “physics” components of the graph so that the points wouldn’t influence each other. I then restructured the generation of the points such that they branch outward from the bottom of the screen over time, with higher points having a wider width range to spawn in. I also changed the color scheme to a black-and-white aesthetic to highlight the branches.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>After playing around with the above code, I then progressed to developing my “tree” but ran into a surprising bug that caused my tree to transform into a rotating pentagon due to the incorrect math I used for generating the tree. Intrigued, I decided to change my idea from creating a tree into the generation of the illusion of three-dimensional shapes.</p>
				<p>After some tweaking and fine-tuning, I came to a satisfying result with the randomly-colored “germs” and their varied sizes and movements, with the user being able to create more by clicking the screen with the mouse. I decided to call the work “Vector Germs” as the shapes were created entirely from vectors and they look somewhat like cartoon-styled germs.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Contributions</u></h4>
						<p>I made the entirety of the code for this artwork, originally taking inspiration from work done by the inspirers mentioned above.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Reflection</u></h4>
						<p>I was really surprised at how well this experiment turned out from an idea that stemmed from an unintended side effect of faulty code.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Highs</u></h4>
						<p>I really like the visual appeal of the experiment, from the way the geometric germs pulse to the way they move around in the black void.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Lows</u></h4>
						<p>The binary tree that I originally intended to create didn’t come to fruition because I couldn’t figure out a proper way to implement it, but in its place I managed to create something more captivating and intriguing.</p>
