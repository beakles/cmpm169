			<h1>Experiment 5 - Word Factory</h1>
			<p>Utilize an arsenal of letters to craft ingenious words. Type letters to create more letters. Combine letters into words by dragging and dropping onto letters. Remove letters from words by clicking and dragging them away. Drag the first letter in a word to move the entire word.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>My inspiration for this experiment drew primarily from the following pieces:</p>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_1_1_01">P_3_1_1_01 by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni with contributions by Joey Lee and Niels Poldervaart</a>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_1_2_02">P_3_1_2_02 by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni with contributions by Joey Lee and Niels Poldervaart</a>
				<p>I was captivated by how the words and letters were “structured” in the above artworks with the way the letters formed connections and paths in P_3_1_2_02 and how the letters overlap with each other in P_3_1_1_01. For my experiment, I wanted to try to mix the best of both worlds and attempt to incorporate a “puzzle piece” element where the user can type in letters to add to the canvas, then the user can combine letters to form words and thus form sentences.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>First, I disabled the scaling text and the blinking text cursor, and I increased the spacing between letters.</p>
				<p>I then inverted the colors and added a “bobbing” motion to give the text the illusion that it is floating in space. However, the letters are treated as one collective, so they do not move around individually. For my experiment, I planned to have words and characters float around in space as individual text rather than as one gigantic singular text that holds all the words and characters.</p>
				<p>I then changed the behavior of the artwork such that letters will scale in size based on the mouse’s Y position.</p>
				<p>I then added randomized colors and fonts for each letter and gave a random rotation to the text to add variety. I thought the randomized fonts was an interesting idea to incorporate into my experiment to highlight the do-it-yourself aspect of the artwork.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>I started by creating a “PuzzlePiece” class that would store the data of the puzzle piece such as the font, color, and size.</p>
				<p>I then added randomization to where the puzzle piece is spawned, added a soft “floating” animation to the puzzle piece, and enabled keyboard input such that only letters (lowercase or uppercase) would be allowed to be inserted into the canvas.</p>
				<p>I then added functionality such that letters can be clicked and dragged around within the canvas. If a letter is placed within range of another letter, the letters will “combine” to form a word. To break apart the word, one can drag any of the letters other than the first letter in the word away from the others. Selecting the first letter in the word will drag all the letters that are a part of the word with that letter.</p>
				<p>For the finishing touches, I added the ability to splice letters in between gaps in words, and added optimizations for cases where it becomes difficult to select a particular letter or for edge cases.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Contributions</u></h4>
						<p>I made the entirety of the code for this artwork, originally taking inspiration from work done by the inspirers mentioned above.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Reflection</u></h4>
						<p>I enjoyed developing the idea of creating something whole and complete out of tiny pieces and building blocks.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Highs</u></h4>
						<p>I really like how crafting the words and sentences from letters turned out both structurally and practically; I thought it was an interesting idea to play around with.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Lows</u></h4>
						<p>Creative burnout and bankruptcy made it difficult to think of an interesting way to use grammar and text to create a unique experiment.</p>
