			<h1>Experiment 3 - Found Footage</h1>
			<p>A broken, glitchy camera feed found at an abandoned facility. Extremely sensitive to sound, it seems to have a mind of its own.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>My inspiration for this experiment drew primarily from the following pieces:</p>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_4_3_3_02">P_4_3_3_02 by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni with contributions by Joey Lee and Niels Poldervaart</a> and <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_4_1_2_02">P_4_1_2_02 by Benedikt Groß, Hartmut Bohnacker, Julia Laub, Claudius Lazzeroni with contributions by Joey Lee and Niels Poldervaart</a>.
				<p>I gravitated towards the way the image gradually warped, distorted, and transformed itself over time. I wanted to see if I could use a similar method but using sound either as a premade audio file or with a live audio feed to distort the image in one aspect or another.</p>
				<p>One idea I thought of for this experiment was to use both a video and audio feed to distort the result akin to the ripples in water when an object lands in it, with louder or higher frequencies distorting more of the image.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>I started with P_4_1_2_02 as it already had the distortion effect I was looking for. I then disabled the keybinds and replaced the image with a video feed.</p>
				<p>I then reorganized the code such that the video image refreshes every frame, which means the “glitch” effect present in the original artwork would add a faint jitter to the image which I was really surprised about. I then attempted to convert the “jitter” effect into a “water ripple” effect that would react to the user’s microphone volume.</p>
				<p>After testing, however, I realized that the website, while not frozen, was running unbearably slow to the point where the video feed wouldn’t show up on the canvas fast enough before it was replaced. I learned later that a distortion effect like the rippling of water is extremely computationally expensive; I tried many ways to adjust the code to squeeze out as much performance as possible, but to no avail.</p>
				<p>Eventually, I gave up and went back to the drawing board with the original artwork I used as references, losing an hour or so of progress as a result. After collecting myself, I chose to scope down my ambitious idea for the sake of creating a more functional and performant piece of artwork.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>After realizing that the “ripple” effect I desired wouldn’t work out due to performance costs, I went back to the drawing board with the example sketch that features the image becoming “sliced” into various blocks. I first started by creating the video feed that will be used as a reference to creating the ripple distortion effect.</p>
				<p>Strangely, the video feed is separated from the canvas boundaries. To fix this, I need to hide the video feed itself then create images of each frame of the video feed within the canvas.</p>
				<p>To get a better perspective and to test that the camera does work, I adjusted the camera source to reflect what my phone’s camera sees. I also tested the microphone input of p5js with my phone’s microphone so that I can later add distortion effects to the frame’s pixels depending on the loudness of the sound.</p>
				<p>To both save on performance costs and to lean into the “found footage” aesthetic I am going for, I deliberately lowered the frame rate of the camera to 24 frames per second. The glitch effects that I plan to re-use from the example artwork and tweak will run at a faster frame rate to further emphasize their impact when the camera is eventually breaking down.</p>
				<p>I then added a “loudness trigger” that completely scrambles the camera feed if the audio in the room is too loud, resetting it to the default, more stable feed after a few seconds. I added a “greyscale” filter to the video feed to give it a more “antique” look.</p>
				<p>I then added various “glitch” effects to the artwork, either dilating or creating a threshold within the image to give the perspective an “unstable” effect.</p>
				<p>As a visual touch, I added lines, a crosshair, and a “recording” prompt to mimic a real camera feed, and I added static sounds to emphasize different actions in the artwork.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>

						<h4><u>Contributions</u></h4>
						<p>I made the entirety of the code for this artwork, originally taking inspiration from work done by the inspirers mentioned above. I initially borrowed the “distortion effect” from one of the examples but I tweaked it enough to completely diversify it from the original in a meaningful way to serve my intended artistic direction.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Reflection</u></h4>
						<p>I started with the “P_4_1_2_02” artwork since it had a general structure that I was aiming for with my experiment. Unfortunately, my first try with experiment was unable to reflect the ideas and concepts that I envisioned for the final product; the performance load was too great to effectively show off on a website. Luckily, I managed to spawn a new idea from the lessons I have learned, and I ended up creating a more polished experiment.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Highs</u></h4>
						<p>Even if the result is not what I initially planned for, I still managed to find an interesting way to incorporate video and sounds into the Experiment 4 artwork that would elevate the experience. I am very proud of the overall “aesthetic” of the artwork that I have created.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4><u>Lows</u></h4>
						<p>Finding a visual effect that was interesting yet performant was much more difficult than I realized, and I ended up losing a lot of progress because some methods to create the desired “ripple effect” just simply didn’t work. I was extremely disappointed that I couldn’t figure out a proper solution as I thought the ripple effect would be an intriguing idea.</p>
